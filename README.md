# DevOps Engineer Assignment

A junior developer has given you his code for a bookstore API, and he claims that 
the client (a bookstore) insists it's deployed on our k8s cluster, otherwise they will not pay
for all the hard work you and your developer coworkers have done. 

Your job is to prepare this API to be deployed on a Kubernetes cluster and <em>(optionally)
for easier local development as a containerized application.</em>

### The application needs:  
- to be safe as possible
- run in multiple containers with all its dependencies
- to have easily adjustable settings (or parameters)
- to have an option to directly view (or edit) raw data in the backend database
- (optionally) to be easily tested in a local environment
without k8s installed

Good luck and have fun!
